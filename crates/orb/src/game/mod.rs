//! The seam between orb and the game it is running inside.
//!
//! Everything above this module — chapters, snapshots, the retry menu, the
//! overlay — is written against [`Game`] and [`State`] rather than against
//! 東方紅魔郷. Only [`th06`] implements it; the point of the seam is that porting
//! to another Touhou game means writing addresses and offsets, not reworking how
//! chapters or retries behave.
